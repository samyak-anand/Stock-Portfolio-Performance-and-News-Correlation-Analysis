CSCO,"Nvidia isn't in this portfolio manager's top picks, but cash is","US stocks (^DJI, ^GSPC, ^IXIC) are off to a volatile start in 2025. Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager Daniel Niles joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills to share his five top investment picks for 2025: cash, Cisco (CSCO), KBWB Bank ETF (KBWB), S&P Midcap Value ETF (IJJ), and Adtran (ADTN). Niles explains why Nvidia (NVDA), investors' artificial intelligence (AI) darling, is not on his list. He says that ""Nvidia has been a big beneficiary"" of ""really strong AI spending on infrastructure over the last two years,"" but he expects ""a pause or digestion phase in AI spending as you get into 2025."" Niles says investors should focus on sectors that benefit from the incoming Trump administration's policy priorities, specifically deregulation and tax cuts. He says Trump's expected policies will benefit ""more of the small and the mid-cap type of names,"" especially as the Federal Reserve may be more hawkish. ""The last time I picked cash as a top-five pick was in 2022 as the S&P went down 19%, and you got pummeled on bonds as well because, remember, inflation was going up,"" Niles explains. ""If everything goes right [in the S&P 500], it's up 10%, but the downside is down 20[%] to 30[%] because multiples compress because inflation comes in higher than what we're thinking, and the Fed doesn't cut, in fact, pauses or raises then yes, obviously, you know cash is in there for a reason.""

CSCO,"3 bullish investor picks for 2025: Cisco, Microsoft, and Reddit","With the first trading day of 2025 underway, IG North America CEO JJ Kinahan joins Brad Smith and Madison Mills on Morning Brief to outline three stocks clients are most bullish on, based on stock activity, and three bear picks. Kinahan tells the Morning Brief team that Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT), and Reddit (RDDT) are the top bullish picks. ""[Cisco] is one that I think is really interesting,"" Kinahan says, adding, ""We hear so much about AI ... and what I think people sometimes forget is you really need the networkers also"" and, ""I think the networking side of it is the most underrated side of what's going on in AI."" He notes, ""Cisco is really well positioned [and] we've seen our clients and our Tastytrade brokerage side really start to over the last three weeks, particularly, buy this stock."" The second name that clients have been ""buying significantly"" is Microsoft, which Kinahan says is ""not a big surprise"" given ""the fact that it's a darling of retail [investors, it's] usually one of the top three names."" ""The last one on there [is] Reddit and what we've seen there is not only our clients loving it. I think there was [some] doubt [for] some people if it could compete in the social media context, [but] they've done an incredible job overall of continuing to add users"" and have gained bullish calls from analysts. On the other hand, Kinahan says three stocks that have seen bearish trading activity heading into 2025 are Dell Technologies (DELL), Delta Air Lines (DAL), and Pfizer (PFE).

DE,Why companies like Walmart are rethinking their DEI approach,"Walmart's (WMT) recent decision to eliminate its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies has sparked a broader conversation about corporate social responsibility. Mills Sadat Dowlat (MSD) LLP Partner Camron Dowlatshahi joins Market Domination Overtime to share his outlook on this evolving landscape. Dowlatshahi traces the evolution of DEI initiatives following the death of George Floyd in 2020, highlighting how companies initially took ""a strong stance supporting under-represented communities."" However, he points out the political and social climate has shifted since then, with ""the fall and the rise again of the Trump administration, conservative movement, and far-right movement in the United States, and the 'anti-woke' movements again. And because of that, you see now companies catering to those populations,"" pointing to businesses like Walmart and Lowe's (LOW). Despite these shifts, Dowlatshahi asserts that ""discrimination is still discrimination."" The attorney remains hopeful that established state and federal laws will continue to protect against workplace discrimination. Although, he acknowledges a concerning trend, telling Yahoo Finance ""I have seen an increase in fear, frankly."" ""The hope is that we can stand on state and federal law that has been in place for decades and decades,"" the MSD partner concludes.

DE,Deere CEO Says Tractor Maker Insulated from Potential Tariffs,"Deere & Co. Chief Executive John May said the tractor maker is in a strong position to confront potential tariffs under the incoming Trump administration, since Deere exports more farm and landscaping equipment from the U.S. than it imports from other countries.

HUM,The healthcare 'barriers' that made this fmr. insurance exec. walk away,"It has been nearly three weeks since UnitedHealthcare (UNH) CEO Brian Thompson was shot and killed in New York City. The suspected gunman, Luigi Mangione, has been charged with several counts of murder and even terrorism, which he pleaded not guilty to on Monday. In the aftermath of this event, Americans have expressed an outcry over their frustrations with dealing with health insurance providers and maneuvering the cracks in the US healthcare system. Center for Health and Democracy (CHD) President Wendell Potter joins Market Domination's Josh Lipton and Yahoo Finance senior health reporter Anjalee Khemlani to speak more about his self-described ""crisis of conscience"" when he worked within the health industry. Potter penned a New York Times op-ed piece last week titled I Was a Health Insurance Executive. What I Saw Made Me Quit. ""I became aware of the barriers that health insurance companies have put in place to assure their profitability, but that have resulted in more and more Americans not being able to get the care that they need, medically necessary care, even with insurance,"" the former Cigna (CI) vice president of communications explains. ""Those barriers that that they put in place to assure profitability and shareholder return really made me walk away. I used to handle financial communications for Cigna, my name was on all of the company's quarterly reports for ten years. So I saw how the company made money, where it came from, what they did with it, but also the way that they were able to earn the profits..."" Potter weighs in on the performance of major health insurance stocks in 2024 and how US policymakers are expected to act to better regulate the industry.

HUM,"Bipartisan lawmakers appear 'aligned' on PBM, insurance reform","President-elect Donald Trump pledged earlier this week that he will ""knock out the middlemen,"" in a jab against pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Major health insurers Cigna (CI), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and CVS Health (CVS) saw their stock prices drop following this statement in Tuesday's session, but appear to be recovering in Wednesday trading. ""They're helping patients kind of manage through the treatment paradigm with respect to which drugs to take, which formulary drugs are on, and kind of managing that whole process.

OSK,Brinker International vs. Oshkosh: Buying on price momentum,"On the latest installment of Good Buy or Goodbye, Hennessy Funds Portfolio Manager Josh Wein outlines his stance on two respective stocks: Brinker International (EAT) and Oshkosh (OSK). Brinker International — the parent of restaurant chains Chili's and Maggiano's Little Italy — is Wein's Good Buy, citing the brand's expanding margins, free cash flow generation, and stock price momentum as it navigates food inflation in the restaurant space. Wein goes on to note the risks involved with investing in Brinker, such as the aforementioned inflation for food prices. ""What we're looking for primarily with a name like this — it's in our Hennessy Cornerstone Midcap 30 fund (HFMDX) — we're looking at earnings growth, valuation and stock price momentum. And so first and foremost, we just put the name in the portfolio in the last month or so,"" Wein tells Julie Hyman. ""And it exhibits all three of those qualities."" Specialty truck manufacturer Oshkosh (OSK) is the portfolio manager's Goodbye, whose stock price momentum has been lacking. ""A lot of their customers are municipalities buying fire trucks, which they make, or ambulances or an industrial company buying a forklift,"" Wein explains. ""They are certainly at the center of what's going on with capital spending. And certainly anytime there's fears over a slowing economy, these names will will take it on the chin, at least for a moment.""
